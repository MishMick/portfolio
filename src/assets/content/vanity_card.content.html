  <h1>An ode to good bois</h1>
  <p>
    &ldquo;A young woman stepped forward from the throng and asked, &ldquo;O'
    great prophet, tell us how we might find love that is unconditional,
    unwavering and unending.&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p>
    The prophet did not answer right away. He looked off into the distance,
    gathering his thoughts. Silence descended upon the crowd. Then he turned his
    gaze upon the young woman and said, &ldquo;Get a dog.&rdquo;
